Currently I am focusing more on DSA and doing DS Algo course from CodingBlocks with one of my friend as we took one 
course together and I am practicing challenges which are included in the course and profile link is attached here 
https://hack.codingblocks.com/app/users/236366

Also revised C++ STL library.

Also I have participated in some contests and solved a couple of coding problems, the code of some of the 
problems is also attached here.
